## 🧠 The Vision

Modern productivity is broken.

You’re stuck using 10+ apps: one for your calendar, one for your to-dos, one for your habits, another for journaling, one for goal-setting, and yet another for project management. The result? Paralysis by analysis, context switching, decision fatigue—and very little gets done.

**Sotask** was born to kill that mess.

Inspired by the **Autofocus System**, built with the power of **Jira**, **Google Calendar**, and **Taskito**, Sotask merges planning, execution, and journaling into one fluid, ADHD-friendly interface—crafted for **individuals**, **freelancers**, and **teams** alike.

This is not just another to-do list.  
This is your personal execution engine.  
This is how you win your day.

## ⚙️ Core Concept: The Three-Column Interface

Sotask's UI is split into **three intelligent columns**, each serving a core function of productivity:

### 1. 📦 **Boxes Column** (The Action Pool)

This is where all your actionable energy lives. Boxes come in 3 forms:

- **Time Blocks**: Drag-and-drop into your Day View to block out focus sessions.
- **Tasks**: Check off when done—they auto-log into your Timeline.
- **Habits**: Track your recurring behaviors. Also check-offable and auto-logged.

✨ Bonus: **AI-Powered Suggestions**

> Based on your Goals and Projects in the Hub, our AI asks smart, verb-based prompts to generate suggested actions. No more "What should I do next?" Just pure momentum.

---

### 2. 🗓️ **Day View Column** (The Planner)

A vertically stacked schedule, broken into:

- Morning
- Noon
- Afternoon
- Evening

Drag Time Blocks from the Boxes Column here to visually map your day.

No need to overthink. Just block your energy chunks and go.

---

### 3. 🕒 **Timeline Column** (The Accomplishment Tracker)

This is where the magic happens. As you check off Tasks and Habits—or complete Time Blocks—**entries automatically populate this journal**, time-stamped and beautifully organized.

> For example:
>
> - `10:00 – 12:00 Coding`  
>    ↳ Scaffolding app  
>    ↳ Set up front-end  
>    ↳ Pushed to GitHub

Each entry is linked back to its parent Time Block with arrows or visual indicators, helping users _see_ what they achieved in real-time.

No more wondering “what did I even do today?”  
Now you see your life stacking, day after day.

## 🚨 The Hub: Your Master Brain

Click the red alert icon in the top-left of the Timeline column to open the **Hub**, a full-screen dump zone for everything in your mind and life.

Inside the Hub are 4 powerful sections:

### 🎯 Goals

Define and track your short-term and long-term goals.  
Use them to fuel your daily actions through AI suggestions.

### 📁 Projects

Just like Jira, but lightweight. Track features, bugs, epics, or anything in between.  
Each project can house a Kanban or list view with linked tasks.

### 📚 Courses

Learning something? Track your progress and write notes.  
Turn knowledge into action.

### 📖 Books

Store your reading list and note summaries—like your personal second brain.  
Write reviews, distill insights, and keep them for life.

Each of these entries is expandable, note-rich, and Notion-inspired.  
Think: minimal friction, maximum thought capture.
